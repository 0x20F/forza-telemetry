# The future
Right now it only supports FM7, maybe FH5 soon enough. The idea is to drag FM8 into this as soon as it releases given the revamped physics engine, they've got to have a lot more data. Other than that there's no plans to add support for the older games yet. If you have a need and requirement for it, make an issue and yell at me ðŸ˜„.
